# Timsort (Python default)

**Timsort** is a [hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_algorithm) [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts) [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm), derived from [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) and [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by [Tim Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)) in 2002 for use in the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered (runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by merging runs until certain criteria are fulfilled. Timsort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3.

Time: O(nlogn)

Space: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[-k]
```



# 堆排序

From Wikipedia: Heaps are arrays for which `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1]` and `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2]` for all *k*, counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that `heap[0]` is always its smallest element.

`heapq module` 是作用在list上的一系列method，用来实现小顶堆。向堆中添加元素，始终维持heap size在k，这样遍历过所有数据后就可以找到第k个最大元素 ，而不是第k个不同最大元素。(因为此时堆里面就只有k个元素，我们并不需要关心是否有重复元素在堆里面，只需要知道堆底的元素是最大，堆顶的元素是第k大)

Java用`PriorityQueue`实现，一样的原理。

Time: O(nlogk)

Space: O(k)

```python
from heapq import *
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heap = []
        for i in nums:
            heappush(heap, i)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heappop(heap) # pop root node
        return heap[0] # when loop ends, the root node is kth largest element
```
