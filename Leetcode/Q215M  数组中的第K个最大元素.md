# Timsort (for Python)

**Timsort** is a [hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_algorithm) [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts) [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm), derived from [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) and [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by [Tim Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)) in 2002 for use in the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered (runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by merging runs until certain criteria are fulfilled. Timsort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3.

Time: O(nlogn)

Space: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[-k]
```



# 堆

Heaps are arrays for which `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1]` and `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2]` for all *k*, counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that `heap[0]` is always its smallest element.

Time: O(nlogk)

Space: O(k)

```python
from heapq import *
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heap = []
        for i in nums:
            heappush(heap, i)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heappop(heap)
        return heap[0]
```
