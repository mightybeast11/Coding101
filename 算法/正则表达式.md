# Regular expression

-   In **regular string**, remember to use double backslash for special characters (`\n`) or character classes (`\d`). The first `\` is to escape the second `\`, so we get a valid digit expression in regular string by using `\\d`.
-   However, in **raw string** (`r""`), all characters are treated as literals. So we can just use `r"\n"` instead of `"\\n"` .
-   **I recommend raw string. It is less confusing.**

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `(...)`    | Group. Can be named and reused.                              |
| `(?:...)`  | Non-capturing group. This part will be **parsed**, but **not captured** for further use. Check this [page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3512471/what-is-a-non-capturing-group-in-regular-expressions) for detailed explanation. |
| `.`        | Any character except new line `\n`. Therefore if we want to express a dot (such as the dot in a float), we need to use `\.` in raw string. |
